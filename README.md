# UnityNetworkCommunication
Scripts that allow networked communication through multiple protocols

Tested in Unity version 2019.1.14f1 

1) UDP Auto-Discovery and communication : The current script supports device auto discovery through broadcast and peer to peer communication. This works in android; other platforms have to be tested

More protocols will be added soon...
